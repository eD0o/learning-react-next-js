### 2.1 - npx create-react-app

Babel and/or Webpack are always required to develop React, but using npx create-react-app everything is already settled.

Components in React are always capitalized: "App", "Header", "Helmet", etc. As well as classes and constructors.

Some words are reserved in .js, as class, that to add an html class for an element it's necessary to use className.

It's only allowed to have one parent element in the JSX.
